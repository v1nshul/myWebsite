        These are the list of my projects. Most of them are incomplete, it's because they are currently in work. If they are completed then I
        will update them on this site, or you can check my git if they are completed or not.

         <div class="synt">
           This is the project me and my team has been currently working on. This bot will give you information about
           any anime you want, like the writers, voice actors and many more.
           For now it have 2 working prototypes:
           The first one works on with the AniList API & the second on uses NLTK.
           you can find out more in the source code.
         </div>
         <div class="synt">
           We are using AniList API to work with this bot, once its complete we will try to launch it into discord :D.

        - Syntaxo (interactive story)
        <div class="synt">
          This was a mini project given by our university to the new students. As the name says, it's an interactive story that changes plots
          based on the choices you made.The story was interesting, I will not spoil it for you guys.
           It was coded in Python, the code was simple, but as a challenge I coverted this story into a website
          , its still in work though. Once completed, I will share the website with you guys.
