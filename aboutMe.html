    In addition to my academic activities, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time. Playing volleyball while watching the anime series One Piece is one of my favourite activities. I enjoy the characters, the plot, and the show's creativity.

    In terms of work experience, I've been fortunate to gain a variety of valuable experiences. Among them are the following: As a student ambassador, I've had the opportunity to represent my university and share information about studying at Coventry with prospective students. I've also had the opportunity to work as a software developer intern. This position provided me with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge from my studies to real-world problems while also developing practical skills in programming and software development.
